# orchestrator/prompt_generators/__init__.py
# This file marks the 'prompt_generators' directory as a Python package,
# allowing dynamic loading of prompt-generating functions.

# You could optionally add imports here if you wanted to expose
# specific generators directly, e.g.:
# from .swot_analysis import swot_analysis
# But the loader.py approach is generally used to avoid listing all here.
