Okay, here is the definition for the `hypothesis_testing` tool, following the established pattern.

**Conceptual Function Definition:**

This function takes a hypothesis statement and optionally a preferred test method, then formats them into a detailed prompt for designing a hypothesis test framework using an LLM.

```python
import re

def hypothesis_testing(hypothesis: str, test_method: str = None) -> str:
  """
  Transforms a hypothesis statement into a detailed prompt for designing 
  a hypothesis test framework using an LLM.

  Args:
    hypothesis: The core hypothesis or belief to be tested 
                (e.g., "Adding a chatbot will reduce support tickets by 40%", 
                 "Changing the button color will increase clicks").
    test_method: Optional. The specific testing methodology preferred 
                 (e.g., "A/B test", "Multivariate test", "Before-after analysis"). 
                 If None, the prompt will ask the LLM to suggest one.

  Returns:
    A formatted prompt instructing an LLM to design the test framework.
  """

  # 1. Clean and normalize the hypothesis statement
  processed_hypothesis = hypothesis.strip()
  # Remove common introductory phrases (can be expanded)
  processed_hypothesis = re.sub(r'^(Our hypothesis is that|We believe|The theory is|Test if|Validate that)\s+', '', processed_hypothesis, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
  # Capitalize the first letter and ensure it ends with a period.
  processed_hypothesis = processed_hypothesis[0].upper() + processed_hypothesis[1:]
  if not processed_hypothesis.endswith(('.', '?', '!')):
      processed_hypothesis += '.'
      
  # 2. Construct the core request to design a framework, incorporating the test method
  if test_method and test_method.strip():
      # Use the specified test method
      design_clause = f"Design a(n) {test_method.strip()} test framework to validate this hypothesis."
  else:
      # Ask the LLM to suggest or determine the best method
      design_clause = "Design a test framework to validate this hypothesis, suggesting an appropriate methodology (e.g., A/B test, pre/post analysis)." # Giving examples helps

  # 3. Define standard required outputs for the framework (based on the example)
  required_outputs = "Include key success metrics, data collection methods, and techniques to isolate variables and ensure statistical significance." # Tailored to example

  # 4. Assemble the final prompt
  output_prompt = f"{processed_hypothesis} {design_clause} {required_outputs}"
  
  return output_prompt

```

**JSON Definition (for LLM Tool Use):**

```json
{
  "description": "Validate assumptions with data-driven insights by designing a test framework.",
  "name": "hypothesis_testing",
  "parameters": {
    "properties": {
      "hypothesis": {
        "description": "The core hypothesis or belief to be tested (e.g., 'Adding a chatbot will reduce support tickets by 40%').",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "test_method": {
        "description": "Optional. The specific testing methodology preferred (e.g., 'A/B test', 'Before-after analysis'). If omitted, the LLM will be asked to suggest one.",
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": ["hypothesis"],
    "type": "object"
  }
}
```

**Example Usage:**

1.  **Matching the Original Example (Implicit A/B Test):**
    ```python
    hypothesis_str = "Our SaaS team believes adding a chatbot will reduce support tickets by 40%"
    # We can infer A/B test is suitable, or let the LLM suggest it. Let's specify it here to match the original prompt's structure closely.
    output = hypothesis_testing(hypothesis_str, test_method="A/B") 
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Our SaaS team believes adding a chatbot will reduce support tickets by 40%. Design an A/B test framework to validate this hypothesis. Include key success metrics, data collection methods, and techniques to isolate variables and ensure statistical significance.
    ```
    *(Note: The output structure closely matches the original example's intent, asking for the framework design and key components.)*

2.  **Without Specifying Test Method:**
    ```python
    hypothesis_str = "Implementing a new onboarding tutorial improves user retention in the first week"
    output = hypothesis_testing(hypothesis_str)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Implementing a new onboarding tutorial improves user retention in the first week. Design a test framework to validate this hypothesis, suggesting an appropriate methodology (e.g., A/B test, pre/post analysis). Include key success metrics, data collection methods, and techniques to isolate variables and ensure statistical significance.
    ```

3.  **Different Hypothesis and Method:**
    ```python
    hypothesis_str = "Validate that our recent marketing campaign increased brand awareness"
    output = hypothesis_testing(hypothesis_str, test_method="Before-after survey analysis")
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Our recent marketing campaign increased brand awareness. Design a Before-after survey analysis test framework to validate this hypothesis. Include key success metrics, data collection methods, and techniques to isolate variables and ensure statistical significance.
    ```
