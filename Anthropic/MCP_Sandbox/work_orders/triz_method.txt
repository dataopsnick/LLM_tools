Okay, here is the definition for the `triz_method` tool, based on the provided example and structure.

**Conceptual Function Definition:**

This function takes the problem/system to improve, an optional specific TRIZ principle, and optional desired output types, then formats them into a TRIZ analysis prompt for an LLM.

```python
import re

def triz_method(problem_or_system: str, triz_principle: str = None, desired_outputs: str = None) -> str:
  """
  Transforms a problem description into a detailed prompt for applying 
  the TRIZ methodology using an LLM.

  Args:
    problem_or_system: The core problem or system to improve 
                       (e.g., "improve solar panel efficiency", 
                        "reduce waste in manufacturing", 
                        "make packaging easier to open").
    triz_principle: Optional. The specific TRIZ inventive principle to apply 
                    (e.g., "Principle 35 (parameter changes)", "Principle 1 (Segmentation)",
                     "Principle 10 (Prior Action)"). If omitted, the prompt will ask
                     the LLM to identify relevant principles.
    desired_outputs: Optional. Specific kinds of suggestions or configurations to explore
                     (e.g., "material modifications and novel energy storage configurations",
                      "process changes and automation ideas",
                      "structural redesigns and alternative mechanisms").

  Returns:
    A formatted prompt instructing an LLM to perform the TRIZ analysis.
  """

  # 1. Clean and normalize the input problem/system
  processed_problem = problem_or_system.strip()
  # Ensure it ends logically, often suitable without a period for 'to improve X' structure
  # Capitalize if needed
  processed_problem = processed_problem[0].lower() + processed_problem[1:] # Often follows 'to', so lowercase start

  # 2. Construct the main part of the prompt based on whether a principle is provided
  if triz_principle and triz_principle.strip():
      principle_str = triz_principle.strip()
      main_request = f"Apply TRIZ {principle_str} to {processed_problem}."
  else:
      # Ask LLM to identify and apply principles if none specified
      main_request = (f"Analyze how to {processed_problem} using the TRIZ methodology. "
                      "Identify relevant TRIZ inventive principles and suggest applications.")

  # 3. Construct the suggestion part
  if desired_outputs and desired_outputs.strip():
      suggestion_request = f" Suggest {desired_outputs.strip()}."
      # Ensure suggestion ends correctly
      if not suggestion_request.endswith(('.', '?', '!')):
          suggestion_request += '.'
  else:
      # Generic suggestion request if no specifics provided
      suggestion_request = " Suggest innovative solutions or improvements based on the principle(s)."

  # 4. Assemble the final prompt
  # Combine requests, avoid double suggestion prompts if principle wasn't provided initially
  if triz_principle and triz_principle.strip():
      output_prompt = main_request + suggestion_request
  else:
      # The main_request already asks for suggestions when no principle is given
      output_prompt = main_request 
      # Optionally add the specific desired outputs if provided EVEN IF no principle was given
      if desired_outputs and desired_outputs.strip():
          output_prompt = (f"Analyze how to {processed_problem} using the TRIZ methodology. "
                           f"Identify relevant TRIZ inventive principles and apply them."
                           f" Focus on suggesting {desired_outputs.strip()}.")

  return output_prompt.strip() # Clean up final output

**Example Usage:**

1.  **Matching the Original Example:**
    ```python
    problem = "improve solar panel efficiency"
    principle = "Principle 35 (parameter changes)"
    outputs = "material modifications and novel energy storage configurations"
    output = triz_method(problem, principle, outputs)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Apply TRIZ Principle 35 (parameter changes) to improve solar panel efficiency. Suggest material modifications and novel energy storage configurations.
    ```

2.  **Without Specific Principle:**
    ```python
    problem = "reduce noise from a kitchen blender"
    output = triz_method(problem)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Analyze how to reduce noise from a kitchen blender using the TRIZ methodology. Identify relevant TRIZ inventive principles and suggest applications.
    ```

3.  **Without Specific Principle but with Desired Outputs:**
    ```python
    problem = "reduce noise from a kitchen blender"
    outputs = "changes to the motor housing and blade design"
    output = triz_method(problem, desired_outputs=outputs)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Analyze how to reduce noise from a kitchen blender using the TRIZ methodology. Identify relevant TRIZ inventive principles and apply them. Focus on suggesting changes to the motor housing and blade design.
    ```

4.  **With Principle but No Specific Outputs:**
    ```python
    problem = "make product packaging frustration-free to open"
    principle = "Principle 1 (Segmentation)"
    output = triz_method(problem, principle)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Apply TRIZ Principle 1 (Segmentation) to make product packaging frustration-free to open. Suggest innovative solutions or improvements based on the principle(s).
