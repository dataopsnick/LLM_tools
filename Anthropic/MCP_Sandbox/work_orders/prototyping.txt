Okay, here is the definition for the `prototyping` tool, based on the provided card and pattern.

**Conceptual Function Definition:**

This function takes a description of the concept or product to be prototyped and generates a prompt instructing an LLM to outline its key aspects and potentially create a visual representation.

```python
import re

def prototyping(prototype_subject: str) -> str:
  """
  Transforms a subject description into a detailed prompt for generating 
  a low-fidelity prototype concept using an LLM, including textual flows 
  and potentially a visual representation request.

  Args:
    prototype_subject: Description of the concept or product needing a prototype
                       (e.g., "a mental health app", 
                        "a new e-commerce checkout process",
                        "an internal dashboard for sales data").

  Returns:
    A formatted prompt instructing an LLM to help design the prototype.
  """

  # 1. Clean and normalize the input subject
  processed_subject = prototype_subject.strip()
  # Optional: Remove leading verbs if necessary (e.g., "Design", "Create")
  processed_subject = re.sub(r'^(Design|Create|Build|Prototype)\s+', '', processed_subject, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
  # Ensure it starts appropriately (e.g., prepend 'a' or 'an' if needed - this is complex, skip for now)
  # Ensure it doesn't end with punctuation that would break the sentence.
  processed_subject = processed_subject.rstrip('.?!,')

  # 2. Define the core request and instructions based on the example
  core_request = f"Design a low-fidelity prototype for {processed_subject}."
  instruction_flow = "Outline key user flows in text"
  # Reference the visual generation part from the example
  instruction_visual = "then generate a wireframe sketch using DALL-E integration (or similar image generation) for visual reference." 

  # 3. Assemble the final prompt
  # Combining instructions similar to the original example structure
  output_prompt = f"{core_request} {instruction_flow}, {instruction_visual}"
  
  return output_prompt

```

**JSON Definition (for LLM Tool Use):**

```json
{
  "description": "Build rapid models to test concepts by outlining key user flows and requesting a visual wireframe.",
  "name": "prototyping",
  "parameters": {
    "properties": {
      "prototype_subject": {
        "description": "Description of the concept or product needing a prototype (e.g., 'a mental health app', 'a new onboarding sequence').",
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": ["prototype_subject"],
    "type": "object"
  }
}
```

**Example Usage:**

1.  **Matching the Original Example:**
    ```python
    subject = "a mental health app" 
    output = prototyping(subject)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Design a low-fidelity prototype for a mental health app. Outline key user flows in text, then generate a wireframe sketch using DALL-E integration (or similar image generation) for visual reference.
    ```

2.  **Different Subject:**
    ```python
    subject = "a customer feedback portal for our SaaS product"
    output = prototyping(subject)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Design a low-fidelity prototype for a customer feedback portal for our SaaS product. Outline key user flows in text, then generate a wireframe sketch using DALL-E integration (or similar image generation) for visual reference.
    ```

3.  **Input with Leading Verb:**
    ```python
    subject = "Prototype an electric scooter rental kiosk interface"
    output = prototyping(subject)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Design a low-fidelity prototype for an electric scooter rental kiosk interface. Outline key user flows in text, then generate a wireframe sketch using DALL-E integration (or similar image generation) for visual reference. 
    ```
