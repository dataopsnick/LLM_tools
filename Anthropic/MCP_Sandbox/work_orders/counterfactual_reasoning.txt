Okay, here is the definition for the `counterfactual_reasoning` tool.

**Conceptual Function Definition:**

This function takes a counterfactual premise (a "what if" scenario) and optionally specific areas to focus on, then formats them into a prompt instructing an LLM to explore the alternate history.

```python
import re

def counterfactual_reasoning(premise: str, specific_focus_areas: str = None) -> str:
  """
  Transforms a counterfactual premise into a detailed prompt for exploring 
  "what if" historical scenarios using an LLM.

  Args:
    premise: The counterfactual starting point or question 
             (e.g., "What if Blockbuster had acquired Netflix in 2000?",
              "Imagine the Roman Empire never fell").
    specific_focus_areas: Optional. A string describing specific domains or impacts 
                            the analysis should focus on (e.g., 
                            "the streaming market's evolution, content production, and global internet infrastructure",
                            "technological development, political structures, and cultural diffusion").

  Returns:
    A formatted prompt instructing an LLM to perform the counterfactual analysis.
  """

  # 1. Clean and normalize the premise
  processed_premise = premise.strip()
  # Ensure it starts appropriately (often with "What if" or similar)
  if not re.match(r'^(What if|Imagine|Suppose)\s+', processed_premise, flags=re.IGNORECASE):
      # If it doesn't start like a question/premise, prepend "What if "
      if not processed_premise.endswith('?'):
          processed_premise = "What if " + processed_premise.strip('.') + "?"
      else: # It's already a question, likely okay
          processed_premise = processed_premise[0].upper() + processed_premise[1:]
  else:
       processed_premise = processed_premise[0].upper() + processed_premise[1:] # Capitalize first letter
       if not processed_premise.endswith('?'):
           processed_premise += '?' # Ensure it ends with a question mark

  # 2. Construct the core request - adapt based on phrasing
  core_request = "Explore the potential consequences of this alternate scenario."
  if re.match(r'^(What if)\s+', processed_premise, flags=re.IGNORECASE):
       core_request = "Simulate the likely outcomes and evolution resulting from this premise."
  elif re.match(r'^(Imagine|Suppose)\s+', processed_premise, flags=re.IGNORECASE):
       core_request = "Describe the world or situation that might have resulted."


  # 3. Add specific focus areas if provided, otherwise add generic guidance
  if specific_focus_areas and specific_focus_areas.strip():
      focus_clause = f" Focus the analysis on impacts related to {specific_focus_areas.strip()}"
      if not focus_clause.endswith('.'):
          focus_clause += '.'
  else:
      # Provide generic guidance if no specifics are given
      focus_clause = " Include analysis of key turning points, major affected domains (e.g., technology, society, economy), and significant deviations from our actual timeline."

  # 4. Assemble the final prompt
  output_prompt = f"{processed_premise} {core_request}{focus_clause}"
  
  return output_prompt

```

**JSON Definition (for LLM Tool Use):**

```json
{
  "description":"Explore 'what if' historical or hypothetical scenarios and their potential consequences.",
  "name":"counterfactual_reasoning",
  "parameters": {
    "properties": {
      "premise": {
        "description": "The counterfactual starting point or question (e.g., 'What if Blockbuster had acquired Netflix in 2000?', 'Imagine AI achieved sentience in 1995').",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "specific_focus_areas": {
        "description": "Optional. Specific domains, industries, or types of impacts to focus the analysis on (e.g., 'the streaming market, content production, internet infrastructure', 'geopolitics, technological advancement').",
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": ["premise"],
    "type": "object"
  }
}
```

**Example Usage:**

1.  **Matching the Original Example:**
    ```python
    premise_input = "What if Blockbuster had acquired Netflix in 2000?"
    focus = "the streaming market's evolution, including impacts on content production and global internet infrastructure"
    output = counterfactual_reasoning(premise_input, focus)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: What if Blockbuster had acquired Netflix in 2000? Simulate the likely outcomes and evolution resulting from this premise. Focus the analysis on impacts related to the streaming market's evolution, including impacts on content production and global internet infrastructure.
    ```

2.  **Without Specific Focus:**
    ```python
    premise_input = "Suppose the Library of Alexandria had not been destroyed"
    output = counterfactual_reasoning(premise_input)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Suppose the Library of Alexandria had not been destroyed? Describe the world or situation that might have resulted. Include analysis of key turning points, major affected domains (e.g., technology, society, economy), and significant deviations from our actual timeline.
    ```

3.  **Different Premise with Focus:**
    ```python
    premise_input = "Imagine electric cars became dominant in the 1920s"
    focus = "urban development, the oil industry, and global conflicts"
    output = counterfactual_reasoning(premise_input, focus)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Imagine electric cars became dominant in the 1920s? Describe the world or situation that might have resulted. Focus the analysis on impacts related to urban development, the oil industry, and global conflicts.
    ```
