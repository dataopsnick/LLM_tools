Okay, here is the definition for the `six_thinking_hats` tool.

**Conceptual Function Definition:**

This function takes a topic or problem statement and formats it into a detailed prompt for an LLM to perform an analysis using the Six Thinking Hats framework.

```python
import re

def six_thinking_hats(topic_or_problem: str) -> str:
    """
    Transforms a topic or problem into a detailed prompt for generating 
    an analysis using the Six Thinking Hats framework with an LLM.

    Args:
      topic_or_problem: The subject, decision, or issue to be analyzed 
                        (e.g., "launching a subscription model for our software", 
                         "improving team morale", "evaluating a new marketing campaign").

    Returns:
      A formatted prompt instructing an LLM to perform the Six Thinking Hats analysis.
    """

    # 1. Clean and normalize the input topic/problem
    processed_topic = topic_or_problem.strip()
    # Remove leading verbs often used when asking for analysis
    processed_topic = re.sub(r'^(Analyze|Evaluate|Consider|Discuss|Explore)\s+', '', processed_topic, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    # Capitalize the first letter
    processed_topic = processed_topic[0].upper() + processed_topic[1:]
    # Ensure it doesn't end with punctuation that might clash
    processed_topic = processed_topic.rstrip('.?!') 
    
    # 2. Define the structure of the request, including all six hats
    #    Based on the example, but ensuring all hats are covered for generality.
    hat_descriptions = (
        "- White Hat (Facts & Data): Objective information available and needed.\n"
        "- Red Hat (Feelings & Intuition): Emotions, gut reactions, hunches.\n"
        "- Black Hat (Caution & Risks): Potential problems, difficulties, critical judgment.\n"
        "- Yellow Hat (Benefits & Optimism): Positives, value, reasons for optimism.\n"
        "- Green Hat (Creativity & Ideas): New ideas, alternatives, possibilities.\n"
        "- Blue Hat (Process & Summary): Managing the thinking, overview, conclusions, next steps."
    )
    
    # 3. Construct the output prompt using the template
    output_prompt = (
        f"Evaluate '{processed_topic}' using the Six Thinking Hats framework. Analyze it considering:\n"
        f"{hat_descriptions}\n\n"
        f"Summarize the insights gathered under each hat. Present the results in a structured format (e.g., a comparison table or a clearly sectioned list)."
    )

    return output_prompt

```

**JSON Definition (for LLM Tool Use):**

```json
{
  "description": "Analyze problems or topics from multiple perspectives using the Six Thinking Hats method (White, Red, Black, Yellow, Green, Blue).",
  "name": "six_thinking_hats",
  "parameters": {
    "properties": {
      "topic_or_problem": {
        "description": "The topic, decision, or problem to be analyzed (e.g., 'launching a subscription model', 'improving team communication', 'evaluating project proposal X').",
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": ["topic_or_problem"],

  }
}

```

**Example Usage:**

1.  **Matching the Original Example's Intent:**
    ```python
    topic = "launching a subscription model for our software"
    output = six_thinking_hats(topic)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: 
    # Evaluate 'Launching a subscription model for our software' using the Six Thinking Hats framework. Analyze it considering:
    # - White Hat (Facts & Data): Objective information available and needed.
    # - Red Hat (Feelings & Intuition): Emotions, gut reactions, hunches.
    # - Black Hat (Caution & Risks): Potential problems, difficulties, critical judgment.
    # - Yellow Hat (Benefits & Optimism): Positives, value, reasons for optimism.
    # - Green Hat (Creativity & Ideas): New ideas, alternatives, possibilities.
    # - Blue Hat (Process & Summary): Managing the thinking, overview, conclusions, next steps.
    #
    # Summarize the insights gathered under each hat. Present the results in a structured format (e.g., a comparison table or a clearly sectioned list).
    ```

2.  **Different Topic:**
    ```python
    topic = "Analyze how we can reduce meeting times"
    output = six_thinking_hats(topic)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output:
    # Evaluate 'How we can reduce meeting times' using the Six Thinking Hats framework. Analyze it considering:
    # - White Hat (Facts & Data): Objective information available and needed.
    # - Red Hat (Feelings & Intuition): Emotions, gut reactions, hunches.
    # - Black Hat (Caution & Risks): Potential problems, difficulties, critical judgment.
    # - Yellow Hat (Benefits & Optimism): Positives, value, reasons for optimism.
    # - Green Hat (Creativity & Ideas): New ideas, alternatives, possibilities.
    # - Blue Hat (Process & Summary): Managing the thinking, overview, conclusions, next steps.
