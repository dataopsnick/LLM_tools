Okay, here is the tool definition for `blue_ocean_strategy`.

**Conceptual Function Definition:**

This function takes a description of the current competitive situation and optional relevant trends, then formats them into a prompt instructing an LLM to apply the Blue Ocean Strategy framework.

```python
import re

def blue_ocean_strategy(current_situation: str, relevant_trends: str = None) -> str:
  """
  Transforms a description of a market situation into a detailed prompt 
  for applying the Blue Ocean Strategy using an LLM.

  Args:
    current_situation: Description of the entity or market situation, often highlighting 
                       competition or saturation (e.g., 
                       "Our fitness equipment company is struggling in a saturated market", 
                       "Our SaaS product faces intense competition in the CRM space").
    relevant_trends: Optional. Specific trends, technologies, or customer needs 
                     to consider (e.g., "remote work, digital health, personalized wellness",
                      "AI advancements, subscription models, sustainability concerns").

  Returns:
    A formatted prompt instructing an LLM to perform the Blue Ocean Strategy analysis.
  """

  # 1. Clean and normalize the input situation
  processed_situation = current_situation.strip()
  # Capitalize the first letter and ensure it ends with a period.
  processed_situation = processed_situation[0].upper() + processed_situation[1:]
  if not processed_situation.endswith(('.', '?', '!')):
      processed_situation += '.'

  # 2. Define the core instructions based on the Blue Ocean framework
  instruction_part1 = "Apply the Blue Ocean Strategy to identify an untapped market segment and make the competition irrelevant."
  # Include the ERRC Grid as it's a key tool
  instruction_part2 = "Use the Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create (ERRC) Grid to propose innovative value propositions or features that could differentiate our offerings and create new demand."

  # 3. Create the consideration clause
  if relevant_trends and relevant_trends.strip():
      # Format the trends nicely if provided
      consideration_clause = f"Consider relevant factors such as {relevant_trends.strip()}."
  else:
      # Provide generic guidance if no specifics are given
      consideration_clause = "Consider relevant industry trends, non-customer groups, and complementary product/service offerings."

  # 4. Assemble the final prompt
  output_prompt = f"{processed_situation} {instruction_part1} {instruction_part2} {consideration_clause}"
  
  return output_prompt

**Example Usage:**

1.  **Matching the Original Example:**
    ```python
    situation = "Our fitness equipment company is struggling in a saturated market"
    trends = "trends in remote work, digital health, and personalized wellness"
    output = blue_ocean_strategy(situation, trends)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Our fitness equipment company is struggling in a saturated market. Apply the Blue Ocean Strategy to identify an untapped market segment and make the competition irrelevant. Use the Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create (ERRC) Grid to propose innovative value propositions or features that could differentiate our offerings and create new demand. Consider relevant factors such as trends in remote work, digital health, and personalized wellness.
    ```

2.  **Without Specific Trends:**
    ```python
    situation = "Our local bookstore chain faces pressure from online giants"
    output = blue_ocean_strategy(situation)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Our local bookstore chain faces pressure from online giants. Apply the Blue Ocean Strategy to identify an untapped market segment and make the competition irrelevant. Use the Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create (ERRC) Grid to propose innovative value propositions or features that could differentiate our offerings and create new demand. Consider relevant industry trends, non-customer groups, and complementary product/service offerings.
    ```

3.  **Different Context:**
    ```python
    situation = "Develop a blue ocean strategy for a new sustainable packaging startup"
    trends = "circular economy principles, B2B logistics, and consumer awareness of plastic waste"
    output = blue_ocean_strategy(situation, trends)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Develop a blue ocean strategy for a new sustainable packaging startup. Apply the Blue Ocean Strategy to identify an untapped market segment and make the competition irrelevant. Use the Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create (ERRC) Grid to propose innovative value propositions or features that could differentiate our offerings and create new demand. Consider relevant factors such as circular economy principles, B2B logistics, and consumer awareness of plastic waste.
