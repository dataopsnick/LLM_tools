Okay, here is the definition for the `swot_analysis` tool, following the same pattern.

**Conceptual Function Definition:**

This function takes a subject/context string and optionally some specific areas to consider, then formats them into a detailed SWOT analysis prompt for an LLM.

```python
import re

def swot_analysis(subject_or_context: str, specific_considerations: str = None) -> str:
  """
  Transforms a subject/context into a detailed prompt for generating 
  a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis using an LLM.

  Args:
    subject_or_context: The entity, project, or situation to be analyzed 
                        (e.g., "expanding my coffee shop chain into Japan", 
                         "our company's current market position",
                         "launching product X").
    specific_considerations: Optional. A string describing specific factors or areas 
                             the analysis should focus on (e.g., 
                             "local competitors, cultural preferences, and supply chain logistics",
                             "financial health, brand reputation, and emerging technologies").

  Returns:
    A formatted prompt instructing an LLM to perform the SWOT analysis.
  """

  # 1. Clean and normalize the input subject/context
  processed_subject = subject_or_context.strip()
  # Simple regex to remove common question beginnings (can be expanded)
  processed_subject = re.sub(r'^(Analyze|Evaluate|Consider|Perform a SWOT on)\s+', '', processed_subject, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
  # Capitalize the first letter and ensure it ends with a period if needed.
  processed_subject = processed_subject[0].upper() + processed_subject[1:]
  if not processed_subject.endswith(('.', '?', '!')):
      processed_subject += '.'

  # 2. Construct the core request
  core_request = "Conduct a SWOT analysis"

  # 3. Add specific considerations if provided, otherwise add generic guidance
  if specific_considerations and specific_considerations.strip():
      considerations_clause = f" considering {specific_considerations.strip()}"
      if not considerations_clause.endswith('.'):
          considerations_clause += '.'
  else:
      # Provide generic guidance if no specifics are given
      considerations_clause = " identifying key internal (Strengths, Weaknesses) and external (Opportunities, Threats) factors."
      
  # 4. Add a concluding actionable request (enhancing the original example slightly)
  concluding_request = " Highlight potential strategic implications or actions based on the findings." # Adjusted from original example's "Highlight risks and mitigation strategies" to be more broadly applicable to SWOT

  # 5. Assemble the final prompt
  output_prompt = f"{processed_subject} {core_request}{considerations_clause}{concluding_request}"
  
  return output_prompt

```

**JSON Definition (for LLM Tool Use):**

```json
{
  "description":"Evaluate strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for a given subject or context.",
  "name":"swot_analysis",
  "parameters": {
    "properties": {
      "subject_or_context": {
        "description": "The entity, project, or situation to be analyzed (e.g., 'expanding my coffee shop chain into Japan', 'our company's current market position').",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "specific_considerations": {
        "description": "Optional. Specific factors or areas the analysis should focus on (e.g., 'local competitors, cultural preferences, supply chain').",
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": ["subject_or_context"],
    "type": "object"
  }
}
```

**Example Usage:**

1.  **Matching the Original Example:**
    ```python
    subject = "I'm expanding my coffee shop chain into Japan" 
    considerations = "local competitors, cultural preferences, and supply chain logistics"
    output = swot_analysis(subject, considerations)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: I'm expanding my coffee shop chain into Japan. Conduct a SWOT analysis considering local competitors, cultural preferences, and supply chain logistics. Highlight potential strategic implications or actions based on the findings. 
    ```
    *(Note: The exact wording of the final sentence is slightly generalized from the specific "risks and mitigation" in the coffee shop example to be more broadly applicable, but captures the intent.)*

2.  **Without Specific Considerations:**
    ```python
    subject = "Our startup's plan to enter the European market"
    output = swot_analysis(subject)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Our startup's plan to enter the European market. Conduct a SWOT analysis identifying key internal (Strengths, Weaknesses) and external (Opportunities, Threats) factors. Highlight potential strategic implications or actions based on the findings.
    ```

3.  **Different Subject:**
    ```python
    subject = "Evaluate the adoption of AI in our customer service department"
    output = swot_analysis(subject, "cost savings, employee morale, customer satisfaction, and data privacy")
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: The adoption of AI in our customer service department. Conduct a SWOT analysis considering cost savings, employee morale, customer satisfaction, and data privacy. Highlight potential strategic implications or actions based on the findings.
    ```
