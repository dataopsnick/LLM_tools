Okay, here's the definition for the `cost_benefit_analysis` tool.

**Conceptual Function Definition:**

This function takes a description of a decision or scenario, optional specific factors to compare, and optional additional analysis types, then formats them into a detailed Cost-Benefit Analysis prompt for an LLM.

```python
import re

def cost_benefit_analysis(decision_or_scenario: str, comparison_factors: str = None, additional_analysis_requests: str = None) -> str:
  """
  Transforms a decision/scenario description into a detailed prompt for generating 
  a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) using an LLM.

  Args:
    decision_or_scenario: The core decision, action, or comparison being evaluated 
                          (e.g., "Should our startup build an in-house AI team or outsource?", 
                           "Investing in employee training program",
                           "Upgrading our current software platform").
    comparison_factors: Optional. Specific costs and benefits the analysis should focus on 
                        (e.g., "5-year costs, IP control, and speed-to-market",
                         "implementation cost, productivity gains, employee retention").
    additional_analysis_requests: Optional. Specific types of analysis to include 
                                   (e.g., "sensitivity analysis for funding changes",
                                    "risk assessment", "qualitative impact summary").

  Returns:
    A formatted prompt instructing an LLM to perform the Cost-Benefit Analysis.

       # Clean up the request slightly
       add_req_cleaned = additional_analysis_requests.strip()

           add_req_cleaned += '.'

       else:
            analysis_clause = f" Also, {add_req_cleaned}" # Use provided instruction verb

  # 5. Add suggestion for output structure/summary
  output_suggestion = " Present the results clearly, potentially using a table to list costs and benefits. Summarize the net benefit or loss and provide a recommendation based on the analysis."

  # 6. Assemble the final prompt

**JSON Definition (for LLM Tool Use):**

  "name": "cost_benefit_analysis",
  "parameters": {
    "properties": {
      "decision_or_scenario": {
        "description": "The core decision, action, or comparison being evaluated (e.g., 'Should we build vs buy?', 'Investing in new software').",

**Example Usage:**

1.  **Matching the Original Example:**
    ```python
    decision = "Should our startup build an in-house AI team or outsource?"
    factors = "5-year costs, IP control, and speed-to-market"
    additional = "Include sensitivity analysis for funding changes"
    output = cost_benefit_analysis(decision, factors, additional)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Should our startup build an in-house AI team or outsource? Perform a Cost-Benefit Analysis. Focus the comparison on factors such as: 5-year costs, IP control, and speed-to-market. Also, Include sensitivity analysis for funding changes. Present the results clearly, potentially using a table to list costs and benefits. Summarize the net benefit or loss and provide a recommendation based on the analysis.
    ```

2.  **Without Optional Arguments:**
    ```python
    decision = "Implementing a 4-day work week"
    output = cost_benefit_analysis(decision)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Implementing a 4-day work week. Perform a Cost-Benefit Analysis. Identify and compare key quantitative and qualitative costs and benefits over a relevant timeframe (e.g., 3-5 years). Present the results clearly, potentially using a table to list costs and benefits. Summarize the net benefit or loss and provide a recommendation based on the analysis.
    ```

3.  **Different Scenario with Different Options:**
    ```python
    decision = "Upgrading our CRM system"
    factors = "licensing costs, implementation time, expected efficiency gains, user adoption challenges"
    additional = "assess the integration impact with existing tools"
    output = cost_benefit_analysis(decision, factors, additional)
    print(output)
    # Expected Output: Upgrading our CRM system. Perform a Cost-Benefit Analysis. Focus the comparison on factors such as: licensing costs, implementation time, expected efficiency gains, user adoption challenges. Also, assess the integration impact with existing tools. Present the results clearly, potentially using a table to list costs and benefits. Summarize the net benefit or loss and provide a recommendation based on the analysis.
